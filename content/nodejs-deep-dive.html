          </div>
          <div class="desc">
              <h3>The main aim of this blog is to give you a brief overview of how Node.js works and how you can understand its workflow on your own.</h3>
              <h3>In this post, I will explore how a higher-level call in Node.js interacts with lower system-level operations and executes tasks. I will briefly touch on key components like the V8 engine, libuv, and the Node.js runtime. This is just an introduction—I will dive deeper into these topics in a future blog post. For now, my focus is on explaining how Node.js operates at a lower level.</h3>
              <h2>Here we can take <span class=" marker highlighter">os.type()</span> function as a example to understand node's internal workflow</h2>
              <h3><span class="marker highlighter">Before diving into the Node.js workflow, let's first understand the Node.js runtime environment in a simple and concise way.</span></h3>
              <h2>The Node.js runtime primarily consists of three main components: the V8 engine, Node.js API bindings, and libuv.</h2>
              <h3><span class="dark">V8 engine:&nbsp;</span>This is written in C++ and is responsible for executing JavaScript code.</h3>
              <h3><span class="dark">Node.js API bindings:&nbsp;</span>These are implemented using a combination of JavaScript and C++, allowing interaction between JavaScript and lower-level system operations.</h3>
              <h3><span class="dark">Libuv:&nbsp;</span>This library, written in C, handles asynchronous I/O operations and provides the event loop and thread pool that power Node.js's non-blocking behavior.</h3>
              <h2>V8 Engine</h2>
              <h3>V8 is Google’s open-source JavaScript engine that powers both Node.js and Google Chrome. It compiles JavaScript into machine code, enabling fast and efficient execution.</h3>
              <h2>Key Features of V8:</h2>
              <h3>JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time): Converts JavaScript to machine code for faster performance.</h3>
              <h3>Garbage Collection: Manages memory automatically by reclaiming unused resources.</h3>
              <h3>Optimized JavaScript Execution: Provides efficient handling of modern JavaScript features.</h3>
              <h3>Coming to Libuv part</h3>
              <h2>What is libuv?</h2>
              <h3>libuv is a multi-platform support library written in C that handles asynchronous I/O operations in Node.js. It enables non-blocking behavior by managing tasks in the background through the event loop and thread pool.</h3>
              <h2>Some of key Functions of libuv includes:</h2>
              <h3>File system operations (e.g., read, write)</h3>
              <h3>Networking (e.g., TCP/UDP sockets)</h3>
              <h3>Timers (e.g: setTimeout, setInterval)</h3>
              <h3>Child process management</h3>
              <h3> DNS resolution</h3>
              <h3>Thread pooling</h3>
              <h3>Although JavaScript is single-threaded, libuv allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent tasks efficiently by offloading them to the system’s background.</h3>
              <h3>You may encounter questions like: "How is Node.js single-threaded yet non-blocking?" it is because of libuv</h3>
              <h2>Node.js API</h2>
              <h3>The Node.js API provides an interface to interact with system-level resources like the file system, network, and operating system processes. It is built on top of V8 Engine , libuv</h3>
              <h2>Overall node js runtime diagram</h2>

              <h2>"So, coming to the content, if I encounter a function or program like this how can you understand what's node do underthehood?”</h2>

               <img src="../pictures/node1.png" alt="simple node program for os details" >
              </div>
              <h2>How does it really work under the hood?</h2>
              <h3>You might wonder why we need the require function for modules like os, but not for built-in methods like console. I'll explain that in another post. </h3>
              <h3>For now, let's focus on how the top layer of JavaScript in Node.js interacts with system-level information.</h3>
              <h2>Understanding Node.js APIs and How They Access System-Level Data</h2>
              <h3>Node.js APIs like fs (file system), os (operating system), and others are exposed to JavaScript, but they rely on C++ bindings to perform low-level tasks. These APIs act as a bridge between the JavaScript environment and the underlying system.</h3>
              <h2>JavaScript APIs (like fs, os, etc.) are located in the lib folder it is purely written in javascript.</h2>
              <h2>C++ Core (which interacts with system-level resources) is located in the src folder.</h2>
              <h3>The os module we used here is a example of  Node.js API.</h3>
              <h3>This is the code base of node js <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node" target="_blank">Source code</a></h3>
              <h3>Node.js APIs are located in the lib folder inside node repo , and if you navigate to it, you'll find a file called os.js</h3>
              <h3>This is the os.js file. inside it will have the type() function which we called in programme.To find the type() function, we can search within the file using Ctrl + F and look for the keyword 'type'. Upon doing so, we encounter the function.</h3>
              <h3>From examining the codebase, we found that the type() function is implemented by calling the getOSType function. This is defined in the module.exports object as follows</h3>
              <div class="dig">
               <img src="../pictures/node2.png" alt="simple node program  os type() details" >
              </div>
              <h2>So, we found that the type() function in the codebase is mapped to the getOSType function. Upon inspecting the getOSType function in the file, we encountered the following code:</h2>
    

              <div class="dig">
               <img src="../pictures/node3.png" alt="simple node program  os type() " >
          </div>
              <h3>Upon searching the codebase again, we encountered the following code snippet:</h3>
              <div class="dig">
               <img  src="../pictures/node4.png" alt="simple node program  os type() " >
              </div>
              <h3>We found that the type value comes from the _getOSInformation() </h3>
              <h3>Here, the type value is extracted from the result of _getOSInformation()</h3>
              <h2>From this, we searched the codebase further and found the following object, which reveals that _getOSInformation() is imported from the internal bindings</h2>
              <div class="dig">
               <img src="../pictures/node5.png" alt="simple node program  os type() " >
              </div>
              <h3>(note: i just commented other to focus on the _getOSInformation() )</h3>
              <h3>In the internalBinding('os') object, the JavaScript getOSInformation method is mapped to the C++ function _getOSInformation. This connection allows Node.js to access low-level system information by bridging between JavaScript and the C++ implementation.
          </h3>
          <h3>This indicates that _getOSInformation() is accessed through internalBinding('os'), which connects to the C++ side of Node.js</h3>
          <h3>To trace the C++ implementation, we navigate to the src folder where Node.js' core bindings are located. In this case, we look for node_os.cc, as .cc files typically contain the main logic. There may also be corresponding .h (header) files that define function declarations.</h3>
          <div class="italic">

          
          <h2>Pro Tip:</h2>
         <h3> Whenever internal bindings are called in Node.js, they typically invoke C++ functions to access low-level system operations. These bindings act as a bridge between JavaScript and system-level APIs. To understand how a particular module works, you can explore the src directory in the Node.js codebase. For instance, OS-related functionality is usually handled in the node_os.cc file, while file system operations are implemented in node_fs.cc. This naming pattern applies mostly to other core modules as well. By tracing these files, you can see how Node.js interacts with the underlying system through libuv and C++ bindings, offering insight into its internal workflow.</h3>
          <h3>ie in short</h3>
          <h3>For OS-related operations, check the node_os.cc file.</h3>
          <h3>For File System (fs) operations, check the node_fs.cc file</h3>
          <h3>Follow a similar pattern for other modules by searching the src directory for corresponding files.</h3>
          <h3>This approach helps trace how Node.js interacts with the underlying system via libuv and C++ bindings.</h3>
     </div>
     <h3>Go to the node_os.cc file and search for getOSInformation</h3>
     
     <h3>From there, we encounter the code:</h3>
     <div class="dig">
          <img src="../pictures/node6.png" alt="simple node program  os type() " >
         </div>
         <h3>by further searching we got the matching</h3>
         <h3><span class=" marker highlighter">This indicates that the getOSInformation method in JavaScript is mapped to the GetOSInformation function in C++.</span></h3>
         <h3>From this, we understand that getOSInformation in JavaScript is defined and linked to the GetOSInformation function in this C++ file.
          code base is given below
         </h3>

         <h3>Here, <span class="highlighter">uv_os_uname</span> is the libuv function responsible for OS-related functionality. By researching, I found that its implementation is located in the core.c file within the libuv src directory.
     </h3>
     <h3>Libuv is an external library and not a part of Node.js core. Its source code can be found in the official GitHub repository.</h3>
     <h3>The source code of libuv <a href="http://https://github.com/libuv/libuv">Libuv</a></h3>
     <h3>The provided code for the uv_os_uname function in libuv is responsible for retrieving system information such as the OS name, release version, and machine architecture</h3>

         <h3>It is the low-level system program implemented with the help of libuv.</h3>
         <h3>For Windows and Unix, different libuv functions are used due to architectural differences. These functions are found in the libuv/src directory, which contains separate folders for Windows and Unix. When the C++ code calls a function, it is routed to the appropriate folder based on the operating system</h3>

          <h2>I don't force you to understand every single line of code, but rather to grasp how these work in Node.js from a deeper perspective. Focus on understanding the mechanism of these modules with respect to Node.js, Node APIs, and libuv, as explained above.
